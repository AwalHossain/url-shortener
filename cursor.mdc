 Take Home Task: Software Engineer
 Scenario:
 Develop a service that generates short URLs for longer, original URLs.
 Functionality:
 ● Theservice should accept a long URL as input.
 ● Implement an algorithm to generate a unique, shorter string representation (e.g., 6
 characters) for the long URL.
 ● Thisshort URL should redirect the user to the original URL when accessed.
 Technical Considerations:
 ● Chooseasuitable data structure to store the mapping between original and short
 URLs
 ● Consider techniques to ensure short URLs are unique and don't conflict with existing
 entries.
 ● Implement logic to handle potential errors like invalid URLs or exceeding a limit on
 short URL length.
 Deliverables:
 ● Functional code for the short URL generator service.
 ● Unit tests covering various scenarios (valid/invalid URLs, short URL uniqueness).
 ● Abrief explanation of your chosen data structure and approach to handling short
 URL uniqueness.
 Evaluation Criteria:
 ● Thecodewill be evaluated for functionality, correctness, efficiency, and adherence to
 best practices.
 ● Thequality and comprehensiveness of unit tests will be assessed.
 ● Theclarity of the explanation for data structure and uniqueness handling will be
 reviewed.
